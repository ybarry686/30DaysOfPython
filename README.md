# 30DaysOfPython
30 Days of foundational Python exercises I completed during my 1st year of university while learning programming through Asabeneh’s 30DaysOfPython.

## 🚀 Goals
- Learn Python fundamentals (data types, functions, classes, OOP, error handling)
- Utilize popular Python libraries for data analysis and computation, including **NumPy** and **Pandas**
- Understand database operations using Python (SQLite, Postgres, etc.)
- Build a portfolio of small Python exercises and projects to apply these concepts   
- Develop problem-solving and debugging skills for real-world Python applications  

## 🎯 Takeaways
- Devloped a small **web application** using **Flask**, integrating Python with **HTML/CSS** for front-end functionality  
- Gained practical experience with **Git** for version control and managing code repositories  
- Built a **generic database class** to handle **CRUD** operations, gaining familiarity with database interactions
- Recreated Python existing classes to reinforce object-oriented design principles 
- Utilized **Jupyter Notebooks** for structured data analysis, visualization, and documentation
